Compiling Ergo with CMake. Usage of testing tools as CTest and CDash, or maybe something else.
``CMake is a cross-platform build systems generator which makes
it easier to build software in a unified manner on a broad set
of platforms''.


Even the most simple project should never mix-up sources with
generated files. CMake supports out-of-source build. Create for example build directory and run cmake from it, all cmake files will be located in build directory.
A good practice is to set a guard (cmake file) which prevent in-source build.
